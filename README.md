# Raymarch Renderer
 Raymarching shader in unity

The program consists of 2 scenes.
* UtilShowcase Scene - shows the various possibilities in which different objects can interact with each other.
* MengerSponge Scene - shows the famous 3D fractal MengerSponge. 

You can mess around in the editor with values in the MainCamera script :) (add infinite repetation in certain direction, change colors, change object positions etc.)
